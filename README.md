# Overview

This sample app for iOS shows the basic use of HMKit to authenticate with the car emulator and send a command to it.

# Configuration

Before running the app, make sure to configure the following in `ViewController.swift`:

1. Initialise HMKit with a valid `Device Certiticate` from the Developer Center https://developers.high-mobility.com/
2. Find an `Access Token` in an emulator from https://developers.high-mobility.com/ and paste it in the source code to download `Access Certificates` from the server

# Run the app

Run the app on your phone, or the iOS simulator, to see the basic flow:

1. Initialising the SDK
1. Getting Access Certificates
1. Connecting and authenticating with an emulator
1. Sending commands
